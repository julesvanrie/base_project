# Basic package setup for students to use

## :construction: Update Nov. 3, 2024

**This repository has been split in two separate repository templates** for front end and back end to improve students' experience (and reduce issues related to their project structure).

- Front end: [repo](https://github.com/julesvanrie/base_project_back) - [wiki](https://github.com/julesvanrie/base_project_back/wiki)
- Front end: [repo](https://github.com/julesvanrie/base_project_front) - [wiki](https://github.com/julesvanrie/base_project_front/wiki)

**Going forward** this original repo will not be maintained. Any updates and issues will be handled in the two template repositories. The code has been moved into a `main-history` branch for archiving purposes.

## Description

This is a generic boilerplate for basic ML/DL projects.
It has the basic functionality for doing one-off predictions based on simple inputs (i.e. not on images for example, or large numbers of inputs).

It contains nothing more than all the configuration files for the project. No actual code.

## What's being used:
- Streamlit for the front end
- FastAPI serving the back end
- Model storage on GCS / MLFlow (python functions to be written)
- Everything to deploy with Docker

## How to use it

Refer to the wiki pages in the two template repositories for instructions:
